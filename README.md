# DS3231
this library was set up as project to finish my first year of my study to become a programmer.
There for this repository contains two word documents with a poster and a document that discribes 
the way you will make youre library before you start building it

This library is written for The DS3231. 

The DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I2C
real-time clock (RTC) with an integrated temperaturecompensated
crystal oscillator (TCXO) and crystal.
The device incorporates a battery input, and maintains
accurate timekeeping when main power to the device
is interrupted. The integration of the crystal resonator
enhances the long-term accuracy of the device.
